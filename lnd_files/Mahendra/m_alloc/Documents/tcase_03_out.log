In this test_03.c test program invoking dyn_alloc() function with 0-bytes,
-1 bytes, more than 1024 bytes. For these output is like this:

--> ptr Addr. -> 0x80ecf40   (for 0 bytes)

(For -1 bytes, here dyn_alloc() function failed to allocate memory, because 
-1 treated as its 2's complement value it is about 4G.)
--> No Memory To Allocate
--> dyn_alloc failed - asked for -1 bytes

--> No Memory To Allocate (for 1025 bytes, more than 1024 bytes)
--> dun_alloc failed - asked for 1025 bytes
