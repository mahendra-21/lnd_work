    This assignment is to allocate dynamic memory to the user in a memory
 optimizated way.
--------------------------
 In this directory contains :
--------------------------
-> library directory
    which having the file's dyn_alloc.c, dyn_free.c, binary_print.c
    These are the Own implemented malloc & free functions.

-> include directory
    which having alloc.h header file. This header file contains the function
    declarations needed by the user.

-> object directory
    which having the relocatable object files generated while building
    the library directory files. These files are using while creating the
    library(static).

-> testfiles directory
    which having all the test file's for the dun_malloc function.

-> executabls directory
    which having all the executables generated to the test files.

-> Makefile 
    It builds the all relocatable object file's to the library directory files 
    and with the help of all ROF's in object directory creating static library.
    
    And this Makefile also builds executable's to all the testfiles directory 
    files.

    For meta_data information in each test case in Makefile give DEF value '1'.
    By default it is 0.

    ROF - Relocatable Object File

-> Documents
    Which having the Doxygen configure file. To run this file use command
    "doxygen".

    In Doxygen configure file: SOURCE_BROWSER is disabled (Source program 
    is not visible in the browser)

    To see Documentation in the browser run the doxygen command in Documents
    directory. After some time it will genarate html (default enabled) format
    directory. With in this html directory run the command 

    " furefox index.html " here you can see documentation in the browser.

    And also this directory contains all output log files for each test case.
